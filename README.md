# Computer Alchemy

This game is an attempt at porting the iPhone/Android game **Alchemy** to Javascript.

## Game concept

You start with basic elements. You can **clone** elements and **merge** them to create new ones, and so on.

The game is completely playable on the client side so eventually it'll run on a **Github** page.

## Current state / Changelog

Right now the game is merely a POC. See it live at http://ozh.org/alchemy
